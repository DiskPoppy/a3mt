The mall directory says there's a grocery store a few floors up.

Good.[wait=30] Now let's get the food so we can head back home already!

Trust me, you don't want to go there right now.[wait=30] It's bedlam, I tell you!

And why should we take your word for it?[wait=30] We're on a tight schedule here.

I used to work there.[wait=30].[wait=30].[wait=30] for less than a day.[wait=30] Then the Manager showed up with some kinda "washing machine". They twisted a few knobs, said a bunch of words, and next thing I know, the whole place's gone bonkers![wait=30] Not sure what happened, but it's too dangerous to go back in the grocery store now.

Look, bub, we just need some veggies for our Stocking Day dinner.[wait=30] We already beat up the five scourges of the island to get this far.[wait=30] I think we can handle a little bedlam.

But the grocery store's the epicenter of all this madness.[wait=30] A co-worker tried to sneak in earlier to grab us some beefsteak and a couple yellow Forest Guardians and almost got killed![wait=30] Sucks 'cause we're pretty hungry.[wait=30] We've been stuck here for days!

It's not just us.[wait=30] It seems like EVERYONE who was in the mall when things went cuckoo is stuck here!

Your name is "Clerk"?[wait=30] Talk about nominative determinism.

I tailed you and Demo right after y'all opened the Purrtal.[wait=30] It was my only ticket into the nexus.

But I thought all residents of the island were allowed to pass through.

I was, until I advised the Purrtal on some poor investments.[wait=30] Then I got banned.

Anyway, Clerk, I have nothing but the greatest confidence in Demo and Iris here.[wait=30] If anyone can force their way out of a situation, these two can.

I guess we've been called upon to save the day once again.[wait=30] We'll poke around upstairs and use violence if we have to.
