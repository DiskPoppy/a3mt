[topic]The Guy Who Quits History[/topic]
It's the story of this dude who is just super fed up with the insanity of humanity,[wait=30] and what they did in the past,[wait=30] are doing in the present,[wait=30] and will probably keep doing in the future.
[wait]
[br]Mind you,[wait=30] he doesn't want to kill himself,[wait=30] or anything,[wait=30] he still wants to live,[wait=30] and so through an unexplained process,[wait=30] the guy quits history.
[wait]
[br]Being separated from history,[wait=30] he is now separated from time,[wait=30] he doesn't age and cannot die as his death is bound to affect someone,[wait=30] even a passerby,[wait=30] thus he is contrained to live,[wait=30] actually,[wait=30] completely unnoticed,[wait=30] as a statistically insignificant head in a crowd.
[wait]
[br]An eternal NPC.
[wait]
[br]He cannot have any meaningful conversations,[wait=30] idle chats with strangers are completely immemorable.

He cannot purchase anything that is not so popular that his one sale contribution would be noticed by anyone,[wait=30] in fact,[wait=30] he can only go into wholesale superstores and franchised fast food restaurants.
[wait]
[br]He cannot hunt or fish for his own food,[wait=30] as he would affect the history of TH.
[wait]
[br]Nothing will ever affect his life or his existence,[wait=30] with the consequence that he will never affect the life or existence of anyone else,[wait=30] in good or in bad,[wait=30] for both the former and the latter. 
[wait]
[br]The story doesn't really end.
[wait]
[br]Living outside of history,[wait=30] he is free to witness the complete evolution of humanity and its end,[wait=30] and then kind of dicks around on a dead planet until the Sun goes supernova.
[wait]
[br]He then gets to float around in space until the heat death of the universe,[wait=30] never to encounter any extraterrestrial life,[wait=30] as that would affect their history too.
[wait]
[br][br]The end.
