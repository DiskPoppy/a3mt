Actually, there's a shopping mall that's a bit closer.[wait=30] There might be a grocery store inside.[wait=30] You'd have to pass through the Purrtal, though.

The Purrtal.[wait=30] It's our link to the interdimensional nexus, where beings from all walks of time and space can come together.[wait=30] So naturally, it was the perfect place to build a shopping mall.

Well, it's not that simple.[wait=30] Y'see, the Purrtal only lets locals pass through, and it doesn't take kindly to outsiders.

Say, if you're headed in that direction, could you check up on a dear friend of mine?[wait=30] They started working at the mall a few days ago, but I haven't heard from them since.[wait=30] I'm getting worried...
