Stop lazing around.[wait=30] Reminder that Uncle Broadsword's making us cater the ENTIRE party for Stocking Day, so I'll need your help.

That's right, it's almost Stocking Day![wait=30] I should go and give Uncle B. his socks!

He's not here, Demo.[wait=30] That's why it's just the two of us, because he's "busy".

Oh yeah, I forgot that Uncle B.'s spending another full day at his digsite.

He didn't even greet us when we arrived here at his cabin.[wait=30] Sometimes, I think he cares about his work more than he cares about us.

Anyway, can you lend me a leg?[wait=30] Take out some zucchinis out of the fridge and start chopping them up.

There's nothing in the fridge.[wait=30] I guess Uncle B. mostly orders takeout.

How annoying.[wait=30] Well, looks like we have to go on a food run.[wait=30] Let's head outside and see if there's any grocery stores nearby.

What, can't we gather food from ? blocks?[wait=30] Calle and I had so much fun doing that with Uncle B. last year!

And then the holiday dinner was incredibly bland.[wait=30] This is supposed to be a feast, Demo.[wait=30] We need store-quality produce.

Filled with determination, Demo and Iris seek out ingredients for holiday dinner.[wait=30] Will they find a grocery store in time?
