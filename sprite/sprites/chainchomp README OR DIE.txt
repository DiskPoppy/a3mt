This is version 1.2, which fixes a bug that caused the sprite to glitch on the Higan/BSNES emulator. Credit to Kaijyuu for the fix.

put these files in your sprites directory in sprite tool:
chainchomp.cfg
chainchomp.asm

There is no included custom palette since there is only one required color.
Go to palette 9 color 8 and set it to: red 80, green 64, blue 160

Feel free to report any glitches to me, SMWEdit, at SMWCentral (or wherever)
